# What Will You Find Here?

This repository is for educational purposes, and is resource for describing how to make use of Git and GitHub.

Most of the relevant content is found in the **git_introduction.md** file where really only the basic operations and scenarios are covered. For the time being, interaction with remote repositories is not covered, but I plan to change this soon.
